Electronics & Communication (EC) engineering broadly deals with systems related to acquiring, communicating, manipulating and analyzing information.

“Electronics and Communication Engineering” is one of the fastest growing field of engineering courses. It involves the transmission of information across the channel.

Electronics and Communication Engineering (EC) compiles in Communication Engineering and core Electronics Engineering. The course concept is to focus mainly on the communication part with the knowledge of the electronics field.

“Electronics and Communication Engineering deals with the electronic devices and software applications. It is an interface of chip level hardware and information technology”.

Electronics & Communication Engineering is like a highway where most of the Engineering branches like: Computer/ IT/ ICT/ Mechatronics/ Electrical/ Instrumentation & Control, etc. get connected in one or the other way
